# hello-world
My first repository 
I'm new to coding so I'm going through the tutorial. The tutorial told me to write a little about myself. I'm a rising senior who runs track and plays in band. I'm a huge New Orleans Saints fan, and a causal observer of basketball. I watch soccer when it's time for the World Cup. I have four siblings and two dogs. I visited China in April. I'm hoping to pick up coding over the summer so I can be better prepared for the world when I enter the workforce.
